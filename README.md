# full_stack_scrape
Python Flask server ready for FS dev, used to display scraping agent live on my dashboard.
Video demonstration, comparing to table on my server to live website after targeting, cleaning, creating web server and serving data to my own table.

## Disclaimer: This application will request on reload of webpage
## I am not responsible for the amount of requests you make from cloning this repository and using the web server.
## Any amount of refreshes that you make, is solely your responsibility.
### Assuming this is possible to work indefinitely since it targets the CSS, unless stylings get redone.

# Background: 
I was interested in how people scraped products off of websites and repurposed them. While making full stack crud Python flask applications with SQL, with login pages.
Had to idea that I can add my web scraping script after I had cleaned the data and was able to save it to a .CSV file and the columns were great on excel in a earlier iteration of the script.
I build out the web server and used the data on my web server, being careful to avoid refreshing too often in testing.

To add, I had wanted to achieve this because before I had use the PapaParseJs framework to view .CSV files while I was learning Data Analytics.
The collecting of data, cleaning and setting up the table for viewing was similar to what I was using the framework for except for static .CSV files.
I mention that because this data was first stored as a .CSV file prior to making it a web server.
